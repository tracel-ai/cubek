//! A flash-attention leaf whose score never leaves registers: `q · kᵀ` lands in manual-mma
//! accumulator fragments, the online softmax runs on them with each row reduced across the four
//! units that hold it, and the accumulator, packed to `f16`, is the `A` fragment of `p · v`.
//!
//! The identity that makes the last step free: an `m16n8` accumulator's two `n8` tiles side by
//! side hold, cell for cell, the registers of an `m16k16` `A` fragment. The component test below
//! checks it through [`MmaDefinition::position_of_nth`] rather than assuming it.
//!
//! Each cube is four planes of sixteen query rows of one head; keys and values are staged in
//! shared memory a block of [`KEYS`] at a time and read by `ldmatrix`, the values transposed on
//! the way. The correctness check runs against a host reference; the throughput is a
//! measurement, ignored by default:
