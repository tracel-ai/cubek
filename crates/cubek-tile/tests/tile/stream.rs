//! Distributing a level's work as one index, which is stream-K.
//!
//! Distributing each axis on its own gives a cube the product of its per-axis runs, which is a box
//! of the grid. A share of the work is not a box: it is a range of the index the axes make
//! together, and may start in one tile and end in another; no box of a four by two grid holds three
//! regions.
//!
//! [`Walk::run`] is that range, and [`Walk::window`] the walk over it. The axes of the
//! distributed work stay `Sequential`, so the walk's counts are the whole grid and its flat index
//! carries every coordinate; an instance's run is `base` and `steps` into it, both runtime values.
//!
//! The first tests here are the assignment on a copy, with no contraction and nothing partial:
//! they prove the runs cover the grid exactly once, and that a run starting late reads the
//! regions it was given.
