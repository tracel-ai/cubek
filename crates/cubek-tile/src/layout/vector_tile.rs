//! [`VectorTile`]: the values one vector load brings, as a tile.

//! An operand says how it is stored, and the kernel picks how wide it loads; the tile a load

//! hold the load's values, so an NVFP4 buffer whose word runs along `K` and whose next pieces are
//! two words along `K` and two columns loads 32 values as 16 along `K` by 2 along `N`.
