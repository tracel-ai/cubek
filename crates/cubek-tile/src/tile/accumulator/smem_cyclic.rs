//! A shared-memory destination the planes of a cube write exclusively, on the cyclic schedule, and
//! a tile that reads the sum back.
//!
//! [`SmemAccumulation`](super::smem_accumulation::SmemAccumulation)'s writers add into every cell
//! at once through atomics, in whatever order they arrive, into a buffer zeroed first. Here each
//! writer's fragments are dealt into as many chunks as there are writers, by their place in the
//! fragment grid, and the drain runs in as many rounds: in round `r`, writer `w` lands its
//! fragments of chunk `(w + r) mod writers` alone, replacing their cells in round zero and adding
//! into them after, with a plain read and write. Every writer works every round, on cells no other
//! writer touches, a cube barrier between rounds, and drains each fragment once: no atomics, no
//! zeroing, and each cell takes its partials in a fixed order, so the sum is the same bits from run
//! to run.
