//! The asynchronous fill under a straight or packed transport ([`Delivery::AsyncPerUnit`]): each
//! unit hands its lines to the copy engine (`cp.async`) rather than loading and storing them, so
//! they land in the stage without passing through its registers, after the fill has returned.
//!
//! A unit takes as many lines as under the straight fill, but walks them in the source's order
//! rather than the stage's. The copy bypasses L1, so neighbouring lanes must read neighbouring
//! source bytes: walking a stage blocked into instruction tiles in its own order hands a warp a
//! sliver of each of many rows, and reads more from DRAM than the stage holds.
//!
//! Nothing here waits: the slot's barrier is handed the copies and flips once they land
//! ([`Slot::release_write`](crate::Slot)), or a blocking copy waits on one of its own
//! ([`Memory::load_from`]).
