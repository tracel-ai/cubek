/// adds the box's slots in the order of their runs and hands the total on to the output.

/// No run waits on another, so the merge does not depend on how the device schedules cubes. The
/// parts are added in the order of their runs, so the total is the same bits whichever run arrives

/// The slots are one operand over the output's axes, in its order, of two boxes a run
/// ([`Partitioning::arrival_slots`]): the first holds the part of the box the run starts in, the
/// second the part of the box it ends in. A run's other boxes are its own whole, so no part needs a
/// third. The counters are one `u32` a box ([`Partitioning::arrival_counters`]), holding zero, and
/// left holding zero. A count publishes the run's part at device scope first, so it runs only where
/// the runtime hands one cube's writes to another within a dispatch (`device_memory_scope`).
